# Example Blog Post

This is a sample blog post written in Markdown. You can write your posts using Markdown syntax and simply push them to your GitHub repository in the `blogs` directory.

To add more posts, create additional `.md` files in the `blogs` folder. They will automatically be converted to HTML and displayed on your blog page when your site is hosted via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Ease of use**: Just commit a Markdown file to the `blogs` directory.
- **Automatic rendering**: Posts are rendered clientâ€‘side using [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/).
- **Flexible formatting**: Use headings, lists, links, images, and more.
